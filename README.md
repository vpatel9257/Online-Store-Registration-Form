# Online-Store-Registration-Form
This project consists of a form that allows users to register to an online store. This form records user information 
such as age, username, password, and asks the user if they want to receive an email about special offers. The user has to 
be between the age of 18-100 years old to pass the age verification on the form. Also, the user is prompted to re-enter their 
password to check if the two passwords match with one another. Passwords must match on the form to register for the online store. 
There are two designated text boxes to match the user password. Usernames and passwords are required on the form to register for the 
online store. Lastly, user information is added to a SQL server database using Entity Framework.
